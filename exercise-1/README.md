 # Exercise 1 - How many cows? 🐮

## Context

The idea of this program comes from a riddle. The solution of the riddle is that, for each word that the user introduces in the question, the number of cows will increase.

## Examples

"How many cows?"
The answer is: 3

"How many?"
The answer is: 2


## Main goal

Write a program that, given a question, returns the number of cows. The program must:

1. Print a message to the customer like: "Ask me" or "Introduce your question".
2. The customer needs to write the question.
3. The program will return (print) the number of cows.

## Secondary goal

Once the program shares the solution, ask the user if they want to play again. 
- If yes -> restart the game.
- If no -> end the program.
