# Read/Write test ðŸ¤–

## Goal

We want a program that allow us to do: 

1. Read a file and print it's content. The user need to introduce the name of the file (you can hardcode it to accelerate the tests).
2. Write the content inputed by the user.
3. Delete the file introducing the file name. If the file doesn't exists, then do nothing or print a message (feel free to do whatever you want).

## Secondary goal

Now that we are able to read and write from files, we want to read the content of a file and create a new file with the reversed content of the first file. In other words, if the content of the file A is "Hello World!", the content of file B should be "world! Hello".
